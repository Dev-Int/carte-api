# Carte

This part of the application is to create a restaurant's web menu.

Start by downloading a file containing the elements of the restaurant menu. A data format skeleton is available to recreate a database.
 
Then you can see the different URLs to retrieve your data:

Name | Methods | Routes
----- | --------- | ---------
Cards | GET | /api/cards/list
Cards | POST | /api/cards
Menus | GET | /api/menus/list
Products | GET | /api/products/list

and display them for customers with the desired design.
